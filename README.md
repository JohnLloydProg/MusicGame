# MusicGame
This is a Osu Clone game which uses the pygame module as its game engine. Currently, this only has 1 finished song but you can import any song you like.

# How to play the game
You just press spacebar when the beats are inside the white circle. The goal of the game is to have a high score

# How to import different song
1. Add the mp3 file of your chosen song and name it as "song.mp3"
2. Create a text file named as "beat_list.txt" where you will add the delays between the beats and add "end" at the end to tell the program that the song is finished
3. Add a background image named as "background_img.jpg" (optional)
